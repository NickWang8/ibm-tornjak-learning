Tasks completed today:
1. IBM Quickstart + Additional Steps

Issues:
1. When using a windows system, there are modifications that must be made in order
   to be able to run the commands.

-> In the DockerFile-backend.container, after line 27, we can add the line:
        RUN dos2unix run_backend.sh
   in order to run the commands correctly.
-> `kubectl delete po -n spire spire-server-0` is a command we can run after applying changes 
    accoring to Maia.
