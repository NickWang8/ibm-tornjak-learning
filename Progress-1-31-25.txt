Tasks completed today:
1. IBM Quickstart (Official)
2. Additional Setup Tools

Issues:
1. The docs for the additional setup tools are fairly vague. Am I supposed to expect an output after running specific commands?

Commands:

- Load the images into minikube
    https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/#7-loading-directly-to-in-cluster-container-runtime 
- Modify the server-statefulset.yaml to use the tornjak backend image
    Apply change
- kubectl apply -f server-statefulset.yaml
- Run the port-forward again

I don't think theres much support in what everything looks like or what it's supposed to do.
I think I ran it correctly but have no way to confirm without Maia.
